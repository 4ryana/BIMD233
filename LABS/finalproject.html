            Final Project Proposal: 
        </h1>
        <h2>
            <i>The Lash Code</i>
            by Aryana Villafuerte
        </h2>
        <p>

As my final project I would like to design an interactive website about eyelash extensions  called <i>Lash Code.</i><br>The content will consist of information about lash styles, sizes, and textures. The website will also include style<br>recommendations for different eye shapes and sizes. 

For a color theme, I would like to use a neutral color palette<br>but also incorporate different hues of pink. For alignment I will be implementing the CRAP design rules and utilize<br>a lot of organization and structure for the page. I will have internal links for each category of 'style' 'length'<br> and 'texture' that will provide a deep understanding of each lash element. For font I will be utilizing a monospaced<br>font to carry on the theme of lash <i>coding.</i> 

<p>I want to implement a behavior portion to the site by allowing visitors to complete a survey or form of what style of<br>lashes they would like and also provide information about their eye shapes and size as well as any concerns they<br>may have. 
For repository organization I will have an images directory that contains examples of lash styles, eye<br>shapes, and a website header or logo. I will also have a video directory that contains content of clients modeling<br>lash styles.

        I will be utilizing Kelly Beauty Boutique as inspiration.
