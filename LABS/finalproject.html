            Final Project Proposal: 
        </h1>

            <i>The Lash Code</i>
            by Aryana Villafuerte
        </h2>
        <p>

For my final project I would like to design an interactive website about eyelash extensions  called Lash Code. The content will consist of information about lash styles, sizes, and textures. The website will also include style recommendations for different eye shapes and sizes. 

</p>For a color theme, I would like to use a neutral color palette but also incorporate different hues of pink. For alignment I will be implementing the CRAP design rules and utilize a lot of organization and structure for the page. I will have internal links for each category of “style” “length” “texture” etc that will provide a deep understanding of each lash element. For font I will be utilizing a monospaced font to carry on the theme of lash “coding.” 

<p>I want to implement a behavior portion to the site by allowing visitors to complete a survey or form of what style of lashes they would like and also provide information about their eye shapes and size as well as any concerns they may have. 

</p>

<p>For repository organization I will have an images directory that contains examples of lash styles, eye shapes, and a website header or logo. I will also have a video directory that contains content of clients modeling lash styles.

        I will be utilizing Kelly Beauty Boutique as inspiration.
